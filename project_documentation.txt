                    HELMET DETECTION SYSTEM - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
                    ================================================

Project: AI-based Accident Prevention in MMS (Modular Manufacturing System)
Developer: Ansh Kumar Tripathi
Organization: Intel Corporation
Project Type: Internship/Industrial Project
Technology Stack: Python, TensorFlow, Streamlit, OpenCV
Dataset: Kaggle dataset trained using Teachable Machine

================================================================================
                                PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Accidents in MMS (Modular Manufacturing System) often occur due to delayed human 
response or oversight. By implementing an AI-powered camera vision system, activities 
can be continuously monitored and machines can be auto-stopped in real-time upon 
detecting potential hazards. This proactive approach can significantly reduce accidents, 
prevent injuries and ensure workplace safety.

SOLUTION:
We developed a comprehensive helmet detection system that uses AI to monitor PPE 
(Personal Protective Equipment) compliance in manufacturing environments. The system 
can detect whether workers are wearing safety helmets and automatically trigger safety 
alerts when violations are detected.
